Each word will be an object.
Each activity will be a method called on that object.
Word, definition, synonyms, antonyms, pictures, sentences will be properties of that object.
Before Activities can be called, all information for the Word must be loaded.


WAYS TO HANDLE INCORRECT ANSWERS
  load a list of fodderWords 5x or 10x the size of Current Words
  fodderWords are unique per each session: they always change

var learningWord = new word();
learningWord.word.synonym(learning[i], fodderWords[i], rightSynonym)
	Would generate the Synonym activity, testing whether user could match the correct synonym for learning[i] to the appropriate synonym stored in rightSynonym which is embedded in a list of wrong answers, fodderWords[i]


If each Activity is randomly displayed during the Learning Session, each Activity needs an ID of sorts to generate randomness.


WHEN IS THE LEARNING SESSION COMPLETE?
  Overall time? 1m, 3m, 5m, 10m set when making account and editable in settings
   

HOW TO HANDLE INCORRECT ANSWERS
  show user correct answer and move on after few seconds
  -or- eliminate wrong answer from possible choices
      user keeps eliminating wrong answers until correct one is found

SHOULD CURRENT WORDS BE CONSTANTLY AUTO-UPDATED?
  when a word becomes learned (333333), should that word be automatically removed from Current Words and replaced with another?

BEGIN LEARNING SESSION
 1 GET data for each instance of currentWords[i]
 2 GET fodderWords[i]
   BEGIN sessionTimer
 3 Determine Activity (random choosing of ID attached to each Activity)
 4 Begin Activity
`5 End Activity.
 6 Repeat 3-6 until sessionTimer hits 0
 7 Display stats: # correct, # wrong, best Activities, worst Activities

END LEARNING SESSION


BEGIN ACTIVITY
  var learningWord[i]
  var fodderWords[i]
  var activity_id
  var amnt_learned for learningWord[i]
  Display activity
  Begin Activity timer
  If WRONG,
    eliminate wrong answer from possible choices (grey it out), keep displaying correct answers and fodderWords
    keep greying out wrong answers until correct is chosen
  If RIGHT,
    Update amount_learned
    Notify user
    Transition to next; repeat until Learning Session is complete
  If RIGHT AND LEARNED=333333
    Move word to Learned, update Current Words, notify user
    Transition to next; repeat until Learning Session is complete
  If Activity timer = 0, execute WRONG
END ACTIVITY
